    <!-- Below you have a few JavaScript Challanges to try for yourself:

Ask the user for the number of kilometers and then output how many miles is that. For example, if the user writes 3.2 you would say that is 2 miles. Remember, 1 mile is 1.6 kilometers.
Ask the user for the radius of a circle and then output the area of the circle. Remember, the area of the circle is PI times the radius squared - look this up online.
This is the same as challenge 1 but you will be converting from euros to dollars. -->


    <script>

        //first challange
        const kilometers = parseInt(prompt(`How many Kilometers?`));
        const mile = kilometers * 0.621371;

        alert(`That is ${mile} miles.`);


        //second challange
        const radius = parseInt(prompt('What is the radius of the circle?'));
        const area = 3.14 * radius;

        alert(`The area of the circle is ${area}.`);


        //third challange
        const euro = parseInt(prompt(`How many Euros?`));
        const dollar = euro * 1.09718;

        alert(`That is ${dollar} dollars.`);
