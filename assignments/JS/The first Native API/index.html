    <!-- In this assignment you will be creating the following program. When the user enters the webpage the are presented with a popup that reads "Which website do you want to visit?" and the user writes a simple word like "google, facebook, youtube, johndoe, whatever" and after clicking "OK" they are redirected the page "https://www.{whatever they wrote}.com". Don't worry if the website doesn't exist.

    We already discussed how to get the inpur from the user using prompt and how to interpolate it into the string that looks like a URL. However, in order to redirect the user you will have to use a Native API which allows you to relocate the user easily. The following line of code redirects the user to Instagram:
    
    location.href = 'https://www.instagram.com';
    The idea is that whenever you change the value of the variable location.href the webpage will go to that url.
    
    If you want to take this one step further, you can ask the user "What do you want to search on Google?" and then redirect them to the page "https://www.google.com/search?q={user input here}", or similarly to Youtube at "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query={user input here}". -->


    <script>
        // let website = prompt("Shkruaj website-in qe deshiron ta vizitosh:");
        // window.open = `https://www.${website}.com`;


        let userInput = prompt("Cfare deshironi te shikoni ne Youtube?");
        location.href = `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=${userInput}`;
    </script>
