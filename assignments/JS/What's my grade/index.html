    <!-- Create a program that gets a number from 0 to 100 from the user which represent the points the user has gotten in the test. From this you're going to give the user a grade from 1 to 5 depending on their points like so:

    0-19 points is the grade 1
    20-39 points is the grade 2
    40-59 points is the grade 3
    60-79 points is the grade 4
    80-100 points is the grade 5
    Display this grade using a pretty message in the console.
    
    Bonus points: Check if the user input is not a number at all, is a number smaller than 0, or a number bigger than 100, and simply output "There was an error in your input" -->

    <script>

        let userNumber = parseInt(prompt('What is your number, from 0 to 100.?'));
        let grade;

        if ((userNumber >= 0) && (userNumber <= 19)) {
            grade = 1;
            console.log('I know you can do more.');
        }
        else if ((userNumber > 19) && (userNumber < 40)) {
            grade = 2;
            console.log('Nice job but you need to try more.');

        }
        else if ((userNumber > 39) && (userNumber < 60)) {
            grade = 3;
            console.log('Good job, could`ve been better!');

        }
        else if ((userNumber > 59) && (userNumber < 80)) {
            grade = 4;
            console.log('Great job!');

        }
        else if ((userNumber > 79) && (userNumber <= 100)) {
            grade = 5;
            console.log('Awsomeeeeee!');
