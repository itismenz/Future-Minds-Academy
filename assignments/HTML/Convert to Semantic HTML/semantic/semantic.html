          <p>
            The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived around 9200 BC,
            based on evidence found throughout the area and especially at the
            much-studied Gault Archeological Site, north of the city.

                Excavations have been conducted in 15 areas, augmented by
                numerous machine-dug trenches and boreholes as well as the use
                of non-invasive geophysical procedures.

            When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa
            tribe. Comanches and Lipan Apaches also traveled in the region.
            Though they came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions,
            few settlements were established for several centuries.

          <p>
            Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, a long
            stable and inactive fault line, on the Colorado River. This fault
            divides the Hill Country to the West of Austin from the prairie
            land to the East.
